# 4. Database connection pool

| Pool Name | `maxPoolSize` | `minPoolSize` | Code Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **master** (primary write DB) | **128** | **64** | 16 |
| **admin** | **10** | 16| 16 |

The master pool is the system's most critical shared resource. At 1,000 TPS, if each transaction occupies a connection for an average of ~8ms, steady-state connection usage = `1000 × 0.008 = 8` connections — well within 128. However, at P99 (15ms) and 1,000 TPS, burst demand = `1000 × 0.015 = 15`. The 128-connection ceiling provides ample headroom but represents a significant MySQL server resource cost. -> should optimize this too.
